And in my hour of darkness

Am          G           F          C
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be

Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the broken hearted people

Living in the world agree
C           G           Am         F

For though they may be parted

There is still a chance that they will see
C           G           Am         F
There will be an answer
C       G       F  Em  Dm  C
Let it be
