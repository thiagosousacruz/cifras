Queen - We Are The Champions

[Intro] Am  Em7/A  Am  Em7/A

             Am  Em7/A
I've paid my dues
                Am  Em7/A
And time after time
              Am     Em7/A
I've done my sentence
                  Am  Em7/A
But commited no crime

            C    F/C
And bad mistakes
             C   F/C
I've made a few
             C             G/B            Am
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
    D7           G
But I've come through
                 F/G                  A
And I need to go on and on and on and on

D           F#m
We are the champions
   Bm      A  G   A
My friend
     D            F#m
And we'll keep on fighting
         G     Ebº
Till the end

Em7         Em6
We are the champions
Gm6    Gm6/Bb    C#º Eº
We   are the    champions
D            C9/E
No time for losers
      F6          G        Am7(11)
Cause we are the champions
        Dm7   Em7/D  Dm7  Em7/D  Dm7  Em7/A
Of the world

               Am  Em7/A
I've taken my bows
                Am  Em7/A
And my curtain calls
                Am
You brought me fame and fortune
        Em7/A
and everything that goes with it
C    F/C
But it's been no bed of roses
              C    F/C
No pleasure cruise
                  C
I consider it a challenge
   G                    Am
Before the whole human race
   D7            G
And I ain't gonna lose

                F/G                    A
And I need to go on and on and on and on

D           F#m
