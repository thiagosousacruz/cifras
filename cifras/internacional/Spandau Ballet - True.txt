Am7 F7+


G        Bm
So true, funny how it seems
C7+                 Eb                G
always in time, but never in line for dreams
          Bm                 C7+
head over heels, when toe to toe
            Em7         C7+
this is the sound of my soul
            G     D/F#
this is the sound
C                        G
I bought a ticket to the world
C            G/B          G
but now I've come back again
C                        G
why do I find it hard to write the next line
     C          Em5+        F7+
when I want the truth to be said
G Em7     C7+       Bm7
I...      know this much is true
G Em7     C7+       Bm7     Am7 F7+
I...      know this much is true
G                   Bm                   
With a thrill in my head an a pill on my 
C7+
tongue
             Eb                      G
dissolve the nerves that have just begun
             Bm7              C7+
listening to Marvin all night long
            Em7         C7+
this is the sound of my soul
            G     D/F#
this is the sound
C                          G
   always slipping from my hands
C                         G
   sand's a time of it's own
C             G/B             G
   take your seaside arms and write the next 
line
   C          Em5+        F7+
Oh I want the truth to be known
G Em7     C7+       Bm7
I...      know this much is true
G Em7     C7+       Bm7     Am7 F7+
I...      know this much is true

but now I've come back again
C                        G
why do I find it hard to write the next line

This much is true, this much is true...
