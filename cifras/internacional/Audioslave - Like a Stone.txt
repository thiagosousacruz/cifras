Audioslave - Like a Stone

[Intro] Am  G  Em  F

[Primeira parte]

      Am    G
On a cobweb afternoon
     Em              F
In a         room full of emptiness
        Am   G
By a freeway I confess
      Em              F
I was         lost in the pages

Am         G
Of a book full of death
 Em           F
Reading how we'll die alone
    Am                   G
And if we're good we'll lay to rest
Em      F
Anywhere we want to go

[Refrão]

Am        C               Am
In your   house I long to be
  Am         C          Am
Room by     room patiently
      F             Am           Am
I'll wait for you there like a stone
      F             Am    E7
I'll wait for you there alone

( Am  G  Em  F )

       Am      G
On my deathbed I will pray
        Em              F
To the          gods and the angels
        Am      G
Like a pagan to anyone
         Em             F
Who will         take me to Heaven
 Am        G
To a place I recall
Em         F
I was there so long ago
      Am                  G
The sky was bruised, the wine was bled
      Em        F
And there you led me on

[Refrão]

Am        C               Am
In your   house I long to be
  Am         C          Am
Room by     room patiently
      F             Am           Am
I'll wait for you there like a stone
      F             Am    E7
I'll wait for you there alone, alone

[Solo] Am        C        Am
       Am        C        Am
       F  Am        Am  F  Am  E7

[Segunda parte]

    F     C
And on I read
   E7              F
Until the day was gone
       Fm7       D
And I sat in regret
   E7                   Am
Of all the things I've done
    F               C
For all that I've blessed
    E7              F
And all that I've wronged
     Fm7            D
In dreams until my death
        E7
I will wander on

[Refrão]

Am        C               Am
In your   house I long to be
  Am         C          Am
Room by     room patiently
      F             Am           Am
I'll wait for you there like a stone
      F             Am    E7
I'll wait for you there alone, alone
