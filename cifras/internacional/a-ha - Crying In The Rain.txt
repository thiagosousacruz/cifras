C     F     G       C
I'll never let you see
  C          F              G       C
The way my broken heart is hurting me
C             F           E         Am
I've got my pride and I know how to hide

I'll do my crying in the rain

If I wait for stormy skies

U wont know the rain from
              G   C
The tears in my eyes

You'll never know that I still love you

So only heartaches remain

F                      Dm
Raindrops falling from heaven

Since we're not together

To hide these tears I hope you'll never see

Someday when my crying's done

I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun
