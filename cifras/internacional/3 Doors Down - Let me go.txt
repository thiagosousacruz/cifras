3 Doors Down - Let me go

(intro)  Am G F G
         Am G E F

Am      G              F       G
One more kiss could be the best thing
One more lie could be the worst
And all these thoughts are never resting
And you're not something I deserve

Am  G            E      F
In my head there's only you now
  C        D    F
This world falls on me
  Am   G          E              F
In this world, there's real and make-believe
  C       D       F
This seems real to me

C    G                    Am              F
You love me but you don't know who I am
Am    G                       Am           
I'm torn between this life I lead and where
  F
 I stand
 C      G                Am                F
You love me but you don't know who I am
Am     G            E   F
So let me go,  Let me go

( Am G F G )

( Am G E F )

Am      G              F       G
I dream ahead to what I hope for
And I turn my back on loving you
How can this love be a good thing?
I not know what I'm going through

Am  G            E      F
In my head there's only you now
  C        D    F
This world falls on me
  Am   G          E              F
In this world, there's real and make-believe
  C       D       F
This seems real to me

C    G                    Am              F
You love me but you don't know who I am
Am    G                       Am           
I'm torn between this life I lead and where
  F
 I stand
 C      G                Am                F
You love me but you don't know who I am
Am     G            E   F
So let me go,  Let me go

Am    C
And no matter how hard I try
G                 F
I can't escape these things inside
Am C     G    F
I know, I know
Am               C
When all the pieces fall apart
 G                     F
You will be the only one who knows
Am   C     G    F
Who knows

 C    G                    Am              F
You love me but you don't know who I am
Am    G                       Am           
I'm torn between this life I lead and where
  F
 I stand
 C      G                Am                F
You love me but you don't know who I am
Am     G            E   F
So let me go,  Let me go

(outro)
C  G                       Am      F
You love me but you don't   You love me but 
you don't
Am     G              Am          F
You love me but you don't know who I am
Am   G                   Am          F
You love me but you don't   You love me but 
you don't
Am  G               E       F
You love me but you don't know me
