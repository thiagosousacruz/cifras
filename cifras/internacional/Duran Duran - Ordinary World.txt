Duran Duran - Ordinary World

[Intro] C  Gm  D#7M A#/D  C#6

[Primeira Parte]

 Dm                          F          G
Came in from a rainy thursday on the avenue
Dm                                  F  G
    Thought I heard you talking softly
Dm                            F           G
I turned on the lights, the tv and the radio
Dm                                   F  G
    Still I can't escape the ghost of you
Dm7                           Am          Am9
What has happened to it all? Crazy, some'd say
  E7                          F
Where is the life that I recognize?

Gone away

[Refrão]

C                            Gm
  But I won't cry for yesterday
                     D#7M
There's an ordinary world
        A#/D       F
Somehow I have to find
C                          Gm
  And as I try to make my way
                 D#7M         A#/D        Gm7(5-)
To the ordinary world I will learn to survive

( Dm7  F  G7 )

[Riff]

[Segunda Parte]

 Dm                          F              G
Passion or coincidence once prompted you to say
Dm                               F  G
    Pride will tear us both apart
           Dm
Well now pride's gone out the window cross the
 F             G
Rooftops run away
Dm                              F   G
    Left me in the vacuum of my heart
  Dm
What happening to me?
  Am             Am9
Crazy, some'd say
  E7                           F
Where is my friend when I need you most?
Gone away

[Refrão]

C                            Gm
  But I won't cry for yesterday
                     D#7M
There's an ordinary world
        A#/D       F
Somehow I have to find
C                          Gm
  And as I try to make my way
                 D#7M         A#/D        F
To the ordinary world I will learn to survive

[Ponte]

 Dm
Papers in the roadside
         F              G
Tell of suffering and greed
 Dm                          F  G
Feared today, forgot tomorrow
         Dm
Ooh, here    besides the news
         F            G
Of holy war and holy need
Dm                             F    G
Ours is just a little sorrowed talk
