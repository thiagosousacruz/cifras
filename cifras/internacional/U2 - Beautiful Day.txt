U2 - Beautiful Day

[Intro] G  Am  C  F  C  G
        G  Am  C  F  C  G

                   G  Am  C  F
The heart is a bloom
       C                    G
Shoots up through the stony ground
              G  Am  C  F
There's no room
   C                G
No space to rent in this town
               G  Am  C  F
You're out of luck
        C                      G
And the reason that you had to care
             G  Am  C  F
The traffic is stuck
               C          G
And you're not moving anywhere
                 G  Am   C  F
You thought you found a friend
            C           G
To take you out of this place
        G   Am    C      F
Someone you could lend a hand
     C        G
In return for grace

                 G  Am  C  F
It's a beautiful day
C               G
Sky falls you feel like
             G  Am  C  F
A beautiful day
       C           G
Don't let it get away

G  Am  C  F
You're on the road
            C           G
But you've got no destination
                G  Am  C  F
You're in the mud
        C                G
In the maze of her imagination
             G  Am  C  F
The love is done
C           G
Even if that doesn't ring true
       G  Am   C   F
You've been all over
        C               G
And it's been all over you

                  G  Am  C  F
It's a beautiful day
      C            G
Don't let it get away
             G  Am  C  F  C  G
A beautiful day

Em      F
Touch me
C               G
Take me to that other place
Em       F
Teach me
C                G              G  Am  C  F
I know I'm not a hopeless case
   C  G


Dm
See the world in green and blue
C
See time move right in front of you
Dm              F
See the canyons broken by cloud
C
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
Dm              F
See the Bedouin fires at night
C
See the oil fields at first light
Dm                      F
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
C                       G
After the flood all the colors came out

                  G  Am  C  F
It's a beautiful day
      C            G
Don't let it get away
             G  Am  C  F  C  G
A beautiful day

Em      F
Touch me
C               G
Take me to that other place
Em      F
Teach me
C                 G
I know I'm not a hopeless case

     G        Am              C       F
What you don't have you don't need it now
          C                  G
What you don't know you can feel it somehow
     G        Am              C       F
What you don't have you don't need it now
          C     G
Don't need it now
                G  Am  C  F  C  G
Was a beautiful day
                G  Am  C  F  C  G
Was a beautiful day
