Bob Dylan - The Times They Are A-Changin'

[Intro] C

 C                  Am
Come gather 'round people
    F         C
Wherever you roam
                    Am
And admit that the waters
  F               G
Around you have grown
       C            Am
And accept it that soon
            F              C
You'll be drenched to the bone
                 Dm
If your time to you
          G
Is worth savin'
                        F9
Then you better start swimmin'
                C/E        G
Or you'll sink like a stone
         C         F       G  C
For the times they are a-changin'

( C  Am  F  C )

       C           Am
Come writers and critics
      F                   C
Who prophesize with your pen
                    Am
And keep your eyes wide
            F           G
The chance won't come again
            C        Am
And don't speak too soon
          F                C
For the wheel's still in spin
                         Dm
And there's no tellin' who
           G
That it's namin'
              F9
For the loser now
         C/E      G
Will be later to win
         C         F       G  C
For the times they are a-changin'

( C  Am  F  C )
( G  F9  C/E  G )

      C         Am
Come senators, congressmen
  F              C
Please heed the call
                    Am
Don't stand in the doorway
        F           G
Don't block up the hall
     C            Am
For he that gets hurt
         F           C
Will be he who has stalled
             Dm
The a battle outside
 G
Ragin'
                      F9
Will soon shake your windows
     C/E         G
And rattle your walls
         C         F       G  C
For the times they are a-changin'

( C  G  F  G  C )

      C           Am
Come mothers and fathers
       F        C
Throughout the land
                Am
And don't criticize
          F           G
What you can't understand
      C             Am
Your sons and your daughters
     F              C
Are beyond your command

Your old road is
 Dm     G
Rapidly agin'
                       F9
Please get out of the new one
        C/E             G
If you can't lend your hand
         C         F       G  C
For the times they are a-changin'

( C  Am  F  C )
( G  F9  C/E  G )
( C  F  G  C )

     C           Am
The line it is drawn
     F           C
The curse it is cast
              Am
The slow one now
      F        G
Will later be fast
         C      Am
As the present now
      F        C
Will later be past

The order is
 Dm      G
Rapidly fadin'
                   F9
And the first one now
      C/E      G
Will later be last
         C         F       G  C
For the times they are a-changin'
