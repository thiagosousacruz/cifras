The Calling - Wherever You Will Go

(intro)  C  G4/B  Am7  F7M

(parte 1)
C          G4/B
  So lately, been wondering
Am7             F7M
  Who will be there to take my place
C              G4/B
  When I'm gone, you'll need love
Am7              F7M
  To light the shadows on your face
C        G4/B            Am7
  If a great wave shall fall
     F7M
And fall upon us all
C          G4/B               Am7
  Then between the sand and stone
           F7M
Could you make it on your own

(refrão)
C           G4/B
  If I could, then I would
Am7           F7M
  I'll go wherever you will go
C            G4/B
  Way up high, or down low
Am7           F7M
  I'll go wherever you will go

C          G4/B
  And maybe, I'll find out
Am7         F7M
  A way to make it back someday
C            G4/B
  To watch you, to guide you
Am7            F7M
  Through the darkest of your days
C        G4/B            Am7
  If a great wave shall fall
     F7M
And fall upon us all
C         G4/B                Am7
  Then I hope there's someone out there
          F7M
Who can bring me back to you

(refrão)
C           G4/B
  If I could, then I would
Am7           F7M
  I'll go wherever you will go
C            G4/B
  Way up high, or down low
Am7           F7M
  I'll go wherever you will go

(parte 2)
Am    F7M              G
     Run away with my heart
 Em               Am
Run away with my hope
 F7M              G    Em
Run away with my love

C           G4/B
  I know now, just quite how
Am7            F7M
  My life and love might still go on
C              G4/B
  In your heart, in your mind
Am7               F7M
  I'll stay with you for all of time

(refrão)
C           G4/B
  If I could, then I would
Am7           F7M
  I'll go wherever you will go
C            G4/B
  Way up high, or down low
Am7           F7M
  I'll go wherever you will go

C            G4/B       Am
  If I could turn back time
            F7M
I'll go wherever you will go
C             G4/B     Am
  If I could make you mine
            F7M
I'll go wherever you will go

( C  G4/B  Am )

            F7M
I'll go wherever you will go
