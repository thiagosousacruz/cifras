Leonard Cohen - Hallelujah

[Intro] C  G  C  G

      C                 Am
I've heard there was a secret chord
      C                    Am
That David played and it pleased the Lord
     F                G                  C   G
But you don't really care for music, do you?
    C                   F           G
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
     Am              F
The minor fall, the major lift
     G/B             E7        Am
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

      F           Am
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
      F           C  G  C  G
Hallelujah, Hallelu--u-jah

 C                              Am
Your faith was strong, but you needed proof
 C                 Am
You saw her bathing on the roof
F                     G          C          G
  Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
   C               F        G
She tied you to a kitchen chair
Am                               F
  She broke your throne and she cut your hair
      G/B                E7         Am
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

      F           Am
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
      F           C  G  C  G
Hallelujah, Hallelu--u-jah

    C                      Am
Now, maybe there's a God above
          C            Am
As for me, all I ever learned from love
  F                 G               C      G
Is how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
                  C                F      G
But it's not to cry that you hear tonight
          Am                      F
It's not somebody who's seen the light
           G/B           Em7         Am
It's a cold and it's a broken  Hallelujah

      F           Am
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
      F           C  G  C  G
Hallelujah, Hallelu--u-jah

[Solo] C  Am  C  Am  F  G  C  G
       C  F  G  Am  F  G/B  E7  Am

      F           Am
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
      F           C  G  C  G
Hallelujah, Hallelu--u-jah

     C                        Am
Oh, people, I've been here before
    C                   Am
I know this room, I've walked this floor
        F                 G              C      G
You see, I used to live alone before I knew you
          C                     F     G
And I've seen your flag on the Marble Arch
            Am                  F
But listen love, love is not a victory march
        G/B                E7     Am
It's a cold a it's a very lonely Hallelujah

      F           Am
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
      F           C  G  C  G
Hallelujah, Hallelu--u-jah

             C        Am
There was a time you let me know
C                     Am
  What's really going on below
     F                   G                     C   G
But now, now you never even show it to me, do you?
     C             F        G
I remember when I moved in you
       Am              F
And the holy dove was moving too
    G/B                           E7      Am
And every single breath that we drew was Hallelujah

      F           Am
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
      F           C  G  C  G
Hallelujah, Hallelu--u-jah

      C                              Am
I've done my best, I know it wasn't much
   C                   Am
I couldn't feel, so I learned to touch
                F                        G  C      G
I've told the truth, I didn't come here to fool you
    C              F          G
And even though it all went wrong
Am                                 F
I'll stand right here, before the Lord of Song
      G/B                    E7         Am
With nothing, nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

      F           Am
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
      F           C  G  C
Hallelujah, Hallelu--u-jah
