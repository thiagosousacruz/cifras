Billy Idol - Eyes without a face

C            Am
I'm all out of hope
                Em               G
One more bad dream could bring a fall
C               Am
When I'm far from home
                       Em
Don't call me on the phone
                     G
To tell me you're alone
C              Am
It's easy to deceive
               Em
It's easy to tease
                   G
But hard to get release

F                G
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
F                G
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
F                G                    Dm
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
               Em7                      C
Got no human grace your eyes without a face.

( Am  Em  G )

C                Am
I spend so much time
                    Em
Believing all the lies
                   G
To keep the dream alive
C              Am
Now it makes me sad
                    Em
It makes me mad at truth
                     G
For loving what was you

F                G
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
F                G
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
F                G                    Dm
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
               Em7                      C
Got no human grace your eyes without a face.
(E - D) rep...
When you hear the music you make a dip
Into someone else's pocket then make a slip
Steal a car and go to Las Vegas oh, the 
gigolo pool

Hanging out by the state line
Turning holy water into wine
Drinkin' it down, oh
I'm on a bus on a psychedelic trip
Reading murder books tryin' to stay hip
I'm thinkin' of you you're out there so
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers

C             Am
Now I close my eyes
             Em
And I wonder why
            G
I don't despise
C            Am
Now all I can do
                 Em
Is love what was once
              G
So alive and new
                         Dm
But it's gone from your eyes
                G
I'd better realise

Refrão:
F                G
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
F                G
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
F                G                    Dm
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
               Em7                      C
Got no human grace your eyes without a face.
               Em7                      C
Such a human waste your eyes without a face

And now it's getting worse.
