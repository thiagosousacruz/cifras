John Lennon - Stand By Me

Intro: C  G  Am F  G C G

          C                       Am
when the night has come,           and the 
land is dark,
        F            G           C        G
and the moon is the only light we'll see.
C                             Am
No, I won't be afraid, no, I won't be afraid,
        F             G         C
just as long as you stand, stand by me.

Refrão:
                         C             Am
So, darling, darling, stand by me, oh, stand 
by me.
       F                  G              C   
Oh, stand,     stand by me,     stand by me.
     G


      C                    G    Am
If the sky that we look upon    should tumble
 and fall,
      F                G             C      G
or the mountain should crumble to the sea.
C                                  Am
I won't cry, I won't cry, no, I won't shed a 
tear,
       F              G         C
just as long as you stand, stand by me.

Refrão 2x;
                         C             Am
So, darling, darling, stand by me, oh, stand 
by me.
       F                  G              C
Oh, stand,     stand by me,     stand by me.
