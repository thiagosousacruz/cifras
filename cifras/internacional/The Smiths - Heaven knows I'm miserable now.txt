The Smiths - Heaven knows I'm miserable now

       C                      Am
I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour
     Dm                        G
But heaven knows I'm miserable now
       C                            Am
I was looking for a job and then I found a job
     Dm               G
And heaven knows I'm miserable now

C      Am
In my life
Dm                      G
Why do I give valuable time
    C                       Am        Dm   G
To people who don't care if I live or die?

( C  Am  Dm  G )

     C               Am
Two lovers entwined pass me by
     Dm                        G
And heaven knows I'm miserable now
       C                           Am
I was looking for a job and then I found a job
     Dm                G
And heaven knows I'm miserable now

C      Am
In my life
    Dm                      G
Oh, why do I give valuable time
    C                       Am        Dm   G
To people who don't care if I live or die?

( C  Am  Dm  G )

          C                 Am
What she asked of me at the end of the day
   Dm                G
Caligula would have blushed
           C                     Am
Oh, you've been in the house too long, she said
     Dm           G
And I  naturally fled

C      Am
In my life
Dm       G
Why do I smile
   C                     Am           Dm       G
At people who I'd much rather kick in the eye?

       C                      Am
I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour
     Dm                        G
But heaven knows I'm miserable now
           C                     Am
Oh, you've been in the house too long, she said
      Dm           G
And I... naturally fled

C      Am
In my life
    Dm                      G
Oh, why do I give valuable time
    C                       Am        Dm   G
To people who don't care if I live or die?
