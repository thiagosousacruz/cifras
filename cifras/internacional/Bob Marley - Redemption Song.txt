Bob Marley - Redemption Song

[Intro]

[Primeira Parte]

     C                     Am
Old Pirates, yes, they rob I
 F             C         Dm
Sold I to the merchant ships
C                        Am
 Minutes after they took I
F          C           Dm
 From the bottom less pit
        C        Am
But my hand was made strong
F        C             Dm
 By the hand of the Almighty
    C                   Am    F   C       G
We forward in this generation  triumphantly

                   C    F        G       
Won't you help to sing    these songs of 
  C
freedom?
       F     G      Am  Am7  Am  Am7  Am  F

       C                            Am
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
             F           C       Dm
None but ourselves can free our minds
         C              Am
Have no fear for atomic energy
                 F        C       Dm
'Cause none of them can stop the time
     C                         Am
How long shall they kill our prophets
           F     C        Dm
While we stand aside and look?
           C               Am
Yes, some say it's just a part of it
       F         C        G
We've got to fulfill the book
