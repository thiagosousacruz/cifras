[Primeira Parte

Am         F
  Another head hangs lowly
  C                G
Child is slowly taken
Am                  F
  And the violence caused such silence
  C            G
Who are we mistaken

         Am
But you see, it's not me
          F
It's not my family
         C
In your head, in your head
          G
They are fighting
            Am
With their tanks, and their bombs
                F
And their bombs, and their guns
         C                            G
In your head, in your head they are cryin'

         A            F
In your head, in your head
    C              G
Zombie, zombie, zombie êh êh
                A            F
What's in your head, in your head
    C              G
Zombie, zombie, zombie êh êh êh ôh

[Segunda Parte]

Am         F
  Another mother's breakin'
 C              G
Heart is taking over
Am                   F
  When the violence causes such silence
 C             G
We must be mistaken

          Am                     F
It's the same old theme since 1916
         C
In your head
                            G
In your head they're still fightin'
            Am
With their tanks and their bombs
           F
And their bombs and their guns
         C                           G
In your head, in your head they are dying

         A            F
In your head, in your head
    C              G
Zombie, zombie, zombie êh êh
                A            F
What's in your head, in your head
    C              G
Zombie, zombie, zombie êh êh êh ôh
