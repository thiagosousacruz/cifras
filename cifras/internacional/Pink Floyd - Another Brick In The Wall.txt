Pink Floyd - Another Brick In The Wall

Am
Daddy's flown across the ocean
 Am
Leaving just a memory
Am
A snapshot in the family album
 Am                                D
Daddy what else did you leave for me
 Dm                               Am

C                  G                   Am
All in all it was just a brick in the wall
C                 G                       Am
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall

 Am
We don't need no education
 Am
We don't need no thought control
 Am
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
 Am                         D
Teachers leave these kids alone
 D                           Am
Hey teacher leave these kids alone

C                  G                   Am

All in all it was all just bricks in the wall

Am
I don't need no arms around me
Am
I don't need no drugs to calm me
Am
I have seen the writing on the wall
 Am                            D
Don't think I need anything at all
                                  Am
No don't think I need anything at all

C                  G                   Am
All in all it was just a brick in the wall
C                 G                       Am
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall
