Bob Marley - Is This Love

[Intro]

[Refrão]

         Am
I wanna love you
      F            C
And treat you right
         Am
I wanna love you
       F        C
Every day and every night
     Am
We'll be together
        F                   C
With a roof right over our heads
        Am
We'll share the shelter
F             C
Of my single bed
        Am
We'll share the same room
 F                C
Jah provide the bread
