[Primeira Parte]

         C                  C5(7M)
I have climbed the highest mountains
        C               C5(7M)
I have run through the fields
         F9         F4+(9)
Only to be with you
         C
Only to be with you

                    C5(7M)
I have run I have crawled
         C                C5(7M)           
I have scaled these city walls, these city 
 F9    F4+(9)
walls
         C
Only to be with you

[Refrão]

        G            F9
But I still haven't found
                  C
What I'm looking for
        G            F9

[Segunda Parte]

                     C5(7M)
I have kissed honey lips
          C                    C5(7M)
Felt the healing in her fingertips
    F9              F4+(9)
It burned like fire
                C
This burning desire

                                C5(7M)
I have spoke with the tongue of angels
        C                  C5(7M)
I have held the hand of a devil
                    F9   F4+(9)
It was warm in the night
                  C
I was cold as a stone

But I still haven't found
                  C
What I'm looking for
