[Primeira Parte]

       C
Well, you done, done me

And you bet I felt it
    G
I tried to be chill

But you're so hot that I melted
   Am
I fell right through the cracks
              F
And now I'm trying to get back

            C
Before the cool done run out

I'll be giving it my bestest
     G
And nothing's gonna stop me

But divine intervention
   Am
I reckon it's again my turn
    F
To win some or learn some

[Refrão]

C            G
I won't hesitate
             Am
No more, no more
           F
It cannot wait, I'm yours

( C  G  Am   F )

[Segunda Parte]

C
  Well, open up your mind
              G
And see like me

Open up your plans
                  Am
And damn you're free

Look into your heart and you'll find
 F
Love, love, love

 C
Listen to the music of the moment
                  G
People dance and sing
                        Am
We're just one big family

And it's our God-forsaken right
       F
To be loved, loved, loved
        F#5-
Loved, loved

[Refrão]

   C            G
So I won't hesitate
             Am
No more, no more
           F
It cannot wait, I'm sure

            C             G
There's no need to complicate
              Am
Our time is short
             F
This is our fate, I'm yours

[Terceira Parte]

C        G/B         Am
  Do do do do do do do do do
 G              F
Do do do do do do
    F#5-
Do do

C        G/B         Am
  Do do do do do do do do do
 G              F
Do do do do do do
F|5-
Do

[Quarta Parte]

                    C
I've been spending way too long

Checking my tongue in the mirror
     G
And bending over backwards

Just to try to see it clearer
     Am
My breath fogged up the glass
           F
And so I drew a new face and laughed

   C
I guess what I'm saying

Is there ain't no better reason
    G
To rid yourself of vanities

F
Our name is our virtue

[Refrão Final]

I won't hesitate

No more, no more

It cannot wait I'm sure

            C             G
There's no need to complicate
              Am
Our time is short
             F
This is our fate, I'm yours

C            G
I won't hesitate
             Am
No more, no more
           F
It cannot wait I'm sure

            C             G
There's no need to complicate
              Am
Our time is short
             F              C
This is our fate, I'm yours
