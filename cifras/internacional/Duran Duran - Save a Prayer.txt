Duran Duran - Save a Prayer

[Intro] Am  C  F7M  D
        Am  C  F7M  D

[Primeira Parte]

Am              C              F7M  D
   You saw me standing by the wall, corner of a main street
Am          C                  F7M            D
   And the lights are flashing on your window sill
Am       C                F7M           D
   All alone, ain't much fun, so you're looking for the thrill
Am           C             F7M               D
   And you know just what it takes and where to go

[Refrão]

F#m       A7M                 D
   Don't say a prayer for me now
 C#m             E      F#m
Save it'til the morning after
           A7M                 D
No, don't say a prayer for me now
 C#m             E      Am    C  F7M  D
Save it 'til the morning after

( Am  C  F7M  D )

[Segunda Parte]

Am            C                F7M               D
   Feel the breeze deep on the inside, look you down into the well
Am         C                   F7M             D
   If you can, you'll see the world in all his fire
Am          C                F7M              D
   Take a chance, like all dreamers can't find another way
Am            C               F7M              D
   You don't have to dream it all, just live a day

[Terceira Parte]

Am                 C             F7M
   Pretty looking road I try to hold
             D
The rising floods that fill my skin
Am                C                 F7M            D
   Don't ask me why I'll keep my promise, melt the ice
Am          C                    F7M
   And you wanted to dance, so I asked you to dance
     D
But fear is in your soul

 Am          C                    F7M
Some people call it a one night stand
            D
But we can call it paradise
