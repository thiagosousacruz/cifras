C             F                      Am    
Uh Uh , ô ô ô ô ô ô ,  let me tell ya now, 
       F       Dm    G    C

 C                            F
When I had you to myself, I didn't want you 
around
       Am           F               Dm       
Those pretty faces always make you stand out 
  G       C
in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch, one 
 F
glance is all it took
Am                 F              Dm  
Now it's much too late for me to take a 
    G        C
second look

C         Am               Dm
Oh baby, give me one more chance
     F
(To show you that I love you)
Am         F          Dm   G
Won't you please let me back in your heart
C           Am              Dm
Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go
 F
(Let you go, baby)
    Am        F          Dm   G       C
But now since I've seen you in his arms

C
(I want you back)
Oh I do now

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
(I want you back)
Na na na na

C                                        F
Trying to live without your love is one long 
sleepness night
Am               F          Dm        G    
Let me show you, girl, that I know wrong 
       C
from right
                             F
Every street you walk on, I leave tear stains
 on the ground
Am             F             Dm     G      C
Following the girl I didn't even want around

Let me tell ya now

Oh baby, all I need is one more chance
     F
(To show you that I love you)

Won't you please let me back in your heart
C           Am              Dm
Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go
  F
(Let you go, baby)
    Am        F          Dm   G         C
But now since I've seen you in his arms

C
Pu pu pu pu

Pu pu pu pu
All I need!

C                   F
Oh, just one more chance
To show you that I love you
Am           F            Dm     G     C
(Baby) baby (baby) baby (baby) baby!

C
(I want you back)
Forget what happened then
(I want you back)
And let me live again!

C         Am             Dm            F
Oh baby, I was blind to let you go
    Am        F          G           C
But now since I've seen you in his arms

(I want you back)
Spare me of this cost

Give me back what I lost!
