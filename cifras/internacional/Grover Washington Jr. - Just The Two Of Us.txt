Grover Washington Jr. - Just The Two Of Us

F7M           E7             Am7
I see the crystal raindrops fall
            Gm7  C7     F7M
And the beauty of it all
             E7                Am  Am7
Is when the Sun comes shining through
F7M       E7                Am7
To make those rainbows in my mind
          Gm7 C7    F7M
When I think of you sometime
                  E7                Am 
And I want to spend some time with you

          F7M    E7     
Just the two of us
        Am G#m Gm7    C7  
We can make it if we try
       F7M      E7    Am      Am7
Just the two of us (just the two of us)
           F7M  E7     
Just the two of us
         Am  G#m Gm7    C7     
Building castles in the sky
          F7M   E7              
Just the two of us
Am      Am7
You and I

F7M          E7               Am7
We look for love, no time for tears
        Gm7    C7    F7M
Wasted water's all that is
              E7              Am - Am7
And it don't make no flowers grow

F7M          E7                    Am7
Good things might come to those who wait
           Gm7       C7    F7M
Not for those who wait too late
         E7             Am 
We gotta go for all we know

         F7M    E7     
Just the two of us
        Am G#m Gm7    C7  
We can make it if we try
       F7M      E7    Am      Am7
Just the two of us (just the two of us)
           F7M  E7     
Just the two of us
         Am  G#m Gm7    C7     
Building castles in the sky
          F7M   E7              
Just the two of us
Am      Am7
You and I

F7M        E7               Am7
I hear the crystal raindrops fall
           Gm7  C7       F7M
On the window, down the hall
                    E7      Am - Am7
And it becomes the morning dew
  F7M        E7              Am7
And, darling, when the morning comes
          Gm7    C/      F7M
And I see the morning Sun
                 E7       Am
I want to be the one with you

         F7M    E7     
Just the two of us
        Am G#m Gm7    C7  
We can make it if we try
       F7M      E7    Am      Am7
Just the two of us (just the two of us)
           F7M  E7     
Just the two of us
         Am  G#m Gm7    C7     
Building castles in the sky
          F7M   E7              
Just the two of us
Am      Am7
You and I
