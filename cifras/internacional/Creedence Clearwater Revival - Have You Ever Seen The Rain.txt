Intro: Am  F  C  G  C  G

Primeira Parte:

C
  Someone told me long ago

There's a calm before the storm
    G                     C
I know, it's been comin' for some time

C
  When it's over, so they say

It will rain a sunny day
    G                      C
I know, shinin' down like water

Refrão:

F           G

         C     G        Am
Have you ever seen the rain

  I wanna know
         C     G        Am
Have you ever seen the rain
F         G               C
  Comin' down on a sunny day

Segunda Parte:

C
  Yesterday and days before

Sun is cold and rain is hard
    G                     C
I know, been that way for all my time


'Til forever, on it goes

Through the circle, fast and slow
    G                     C
I know, it can't stop, I wonder

Refrão:

Have you ever seen the rain
F         G               C
