Louis Armstrong - What A Wonderful World

        C        G   F           C
I see trees of green, red roses too
   F         C        E      Am
I see them bloom, for me and you
       F                        G        C   
And I think to myself, What a wonderful world
 G C

        C       G   F              C
I see skies of blue and clouds of white
      F             C        E           Am
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night
      F                        G        C    
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
G C


      G                        C
The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the 
sky
     G                    C
Are also on the faces of people goin' by
        F              C            F        
I see friends shaking hands, saying, "How do 
     C
you do?"
F                C       F            G
They're really saying,  "I   love    you"
   C          G  F              C
I hear babies cry, I watch them grow
F                   C     E              Am
They'll learn much more  than I'll ever know
      F              G                   C   
And I think to myself what a wonderful world
G C

      F               G                  C   
Yes I think to myself, what a wonderful world
