Linkin Park - In The End

In√≠cio 4x: Em  D

                   Am
It starts with One thing I don't know why
        G
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
        F
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
        G
To explain in due time
        Am
All I know Time is a valuable thing
        G
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
        F
Watch it count down to the end of the day
        G
The clock ticks life away
          Am
It's so unreal Didn't look out below
        G
Watch the time go right out the window
        F
Trying to hold on but didn't even know
        G
Wasted it all just to
                Am
Watch you go I kept everything inside
                G
And even though I tried it all fell apart
                F
What it meant to me will eventually
            G
Be a memory of a time when

           Am              C               G 
I tried so hard And got so far But in the end
                   F
 It doesn't even matter
           Am              C               G
I had to fall To lose it all But in the end 
                    F
It doesn't even matter

Am
One thing I don't know why
   G
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
F
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
     G
To remind myself how
           Am
I tried so hard In spite of the way you were 
mocking me
G
Acting like I was part of your property
  F
Remembering all the times you've fought with 
me
        G               Am
I'm surprised it got so far

Things aren't the way they were before
G
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
F
Not that you knew me back then
       G
But it all comes back to me
        Am
(In the end)
You kept everything inside
    G
And even though I tried it all fell apart
F
What it meant to me will eventually
G
Be a memory of a time when

           Am              C               G 
I tried so hard And got so far But in the end
                   F
 It doesn't even matter
           Am              C               G
I had to fall To lose it all But in the end 
                    F
It doesn't even matter

             Am    G            F            
I put my trust in you Pushed as far as I can 
  G
go
             Am               G             
And for all this There's only one thing you 
          F   G
should know

             Am    G            F            
I put my trust in you Pushed as far as I can 
  G
go
             Am               G             
And for all this There's only one thing you 
          F   G
should know

           Am              C               G 
I tried so hard And got so far But in the end
                   F
 It doesn't even matter
           Am              C               G
I had to fall To lose it all But in the end 
                    F
It doesn't even matter
