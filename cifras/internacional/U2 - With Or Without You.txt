U2 - With Or Without You

[Intro]

C      G                 Am
See the stone set in your eyes,
         F                   C
See the thorn twist in your side
  G         Am   F
I wait for you

 C         G                 Am
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
            F                   C
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
        G             Am   F
And I wait....without you

           C     G
With or without you
           Am    F
With or without you

 C         G                 Am
Through the storm we reach the shore
            F                   C
You give it all but I want more
        G             Am   F
And I'm waiting for you

           C     G               Am   F
With or without you, with or without you
         C     G       Am    F
I can't live with or without you

( C G Am F )

         C             G
And you give yourself away
         Am            F
And you give yourself away
         C
And you give
         G
And you give
         Am            F
And you give yourself away
     C        G
My hands are tied
    Am         F               C
My body bruised, she's got me with
           G
Nothing to win
          Am         F
And nothing left to lose

         C             G
And you give yourself away
         Am            F
And you give yourself away
         C
And you give
         G
And you give
         Am            F
And you give yourself away

           C     G
With or without you
           Am    F
With or without you
          C   G
I can't live
           Am   F
With or without you

[Refr√£o]

C     G
With or without you
           Am    F
With or without you
          C   G
I can't live
           Am   F
With or without you
