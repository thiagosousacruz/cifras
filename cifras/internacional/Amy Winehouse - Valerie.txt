Amy Winehouse - Valerie

[Primeira Parte]

           C  
Well, sometimes I go out by myself
                       Dm
And I look across the water
        C
And I think of all the things 

Of what you're doing
                      Dm
In my head I paint a picture

[Pré-refrão]

 F 
Since I've come home
          Em
Well, my body's been a mess
       F
And I miss your ginger hair
         Em
And the way you like to dress
F
  Oh, won't you come on over?
Em                             G
    Stop making a fool out of me

Why don't you come on over

[Refrão]

     C        Dm
Valerie, Valerie
     C        Dm
Valerie, Valerie

[Segunda Parte]

         C
Did you have to go to jail?

Put your house out up for sale?
                    Dm 
Did you get a good lawyer?
            C
I hope you didn't catch a tan,

Hope you find the right man
               Dm
Who'll fix it for you

          C
Are you shopping anywhere?

Change the color of your hair
             Dm
And are you busy?
         C
Did you have to pay that fine

That you were dodging all the time?
               Dm
Are you still dizzy?
