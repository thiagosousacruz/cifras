a-ha - Hunting High and Low

[Primeira Parte]

 Am               F7M                 Fm
Here I am and within the reach of my hand
       Am                      F7M
She's sound asleep and she's sweeter now
          Db      Cm
Than my wildest dream could have seen her
       Ab                  G
And I watch her slipping away

        F           G       Am          Am/G  F7M  Dm
But I know I'll be hunting high and low      high
           Am                        Dm  Em7
There's no end to the lenghts I'll go  to
         Am          Am/G  F7M  Dm
Hunting high and low      high

There's no end to the lenghts I'll go  to

 Am            Am/G         F7M                Fm
Find her again      upon this my dreams are depending
   Am            Am/G   F7M                  Db
Through the dark     I sense the pouding of her heart
 Cm      Bb              Ab                   G
Next to mine she's the sweetest love I could find
