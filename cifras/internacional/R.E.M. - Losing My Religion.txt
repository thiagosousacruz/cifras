R.E.M. - Losing My Religion

[Intro] F  Am  F  Am

[Primeira Parte]

G      Am
  Oh, life is bigger
Em
   It's bigger than you
             Am
And you are not me
                         Em
The lengths that I will go to
                     Am
The distance in your eyes
Em                       Dm
   Oh, no I've said too much
         G
I set it up

                  Am
That's me in the corner
                   Em
That's me in the spot light
             Am
Losing my religion
           Em
Trying to keep up with you
       Am
And I don't know if I can do it
Em                       Dm
   Oh no, I've said too much
                 G
I haven't said enough

[Refrão]

                            F
I thought that I heard you laughing
                            Am
I thought that I heard you sing
    F                         Am  G
I think I thought I saw you try

[Primeira Parte]

        Am
Every whisper
                 Em
Of every waking hour
                    Am
I'm choosing my confessions
           Em
Trying to keep an eye on you
        Am
Like a hurt lost and blinded fool, fool
Em                       Dm
   Oh, no I've said too much
         G
I set it up

           Am
Consider this, consider this
     Em
The hint of the century
           Am
Consider this
                Em
The slip that brought me

To my knees failed
  Am
What if all these fantasies
     Em
Come    flailing around
          Dm       G
Now I've said too much

[Refrão]

                            F
I thought that I heard you laughing
                            Am
I thought that I heard you sing
    F                         Am  G
I think I thought I saw you try

[Segunda Parte]

( Am  G  F  G )

      C               D
But that was just a dream
  C               D
That was just a dream

[Primeira Parte]

                  Am
That's me in the corner
                   Em
That's me in the spot light
             Am
Losing my religion
           Em
Trying to keep up with you
       Am
And I don't know if I can do it
Em                       Dm
   Oh, no I've said too much
                 G
I haven't said enough

[Refrão Final]

                            F
I thought that I heard you laughing
                            Am
I thought that I heard you sing
    F                         Am
I think I thought I saw you try

      F
But that was just a dream
  Am
Try, cry, why, try
  F
That was just a dream
         Am            G          Am
Just a dream, just a dream, dream
