Dm              G       Am                    C
I'll say it anyway   today's another day to find you

So needless to say   I'm odds and ends  But that's me
  Dm        G    Am                           C
Stumbling away slowly learning that life is O.K

The things that you say   Is it live or just to play
    Dm         G     Am                      C
My worries away You're all the things I've got to remember

In a day or two
