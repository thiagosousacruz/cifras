[Primeira Parte]

C                Dm
I would say I'm sorry if
    Em                    F
I thought that it would change your mind
 C                Dm
But I know that this time
        Em                  F
I have said too much, been to unkind

[Pré-Refrão]

Em          Dm
  I try to laugh about it
 Em                   Dm
Cover it all up with lies
Em          Dm
  I try to laugh about it
 Em                  Dm
Hiding the tears in my eyes

[Refrão]

      C  Dm         Em   F
Cos' boys   don't cry

( F5  E5   D5 )

 C    Dm     Em   F
Boys don't cry

( F5  E5   D5 )

[Segunda Parte]

C                  Dm
I would break down at your feet
     Em                F
And beg forgiveness, plead with you
 C              Dm
But I know that it's too late
     Em                  F
And now there's nothing left that I can do

[Pré-Refrão]

Em             Dm
  So I try to laugh about it
 Em                   Dm
Cover it all up with lies
Em          Dm
  I try to laugh about it
 Em                  Dm
Hiding the tears in my eyes

[Refrão]

      C  Dm         Em   F

[Terceira Parte]

C                  Dm             Em
I would tell you that I loved you if
                F
I thought that you would stay
 C              Dm
But I know that it's no use that
 Em             F
You've already gone away

[Ponte]

G                 Am
  Misjudged your limit
G                 Am
  Pushed you too far
G                Am
  Took you for granted
    Dm                        G
I thought that you needed me more

 C                  Dm
Now I would do most anything
    Em                 F
To get you back by my side
 C          Dm
But I just keep on laughing
 Em                    F
Hiding the tears in my eyes

[Refrão]

      C           Dm  Em   F
