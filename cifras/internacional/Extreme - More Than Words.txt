        C  F9  Dm7  F  G

[Primeira Parte]

C            F9
  Saying "I love you"
Dm7                F       G         C
Is not the word I want to hear from you
                 F9     Dm7
It's not that I want you    not to say
    F      G
But if you only knew

[Segunda Parte]

Am    Dm7  G                C      G    
  How easy it would be to show me how you 
   Am
feel
           Dm7
More than words
   G                C7            F
Is all you have to do to make it real
          Fm               C            Am
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love 
me
      Dm7    G
Cause I'd already know

[Terceira Parte]

C                 G        Am        Em    
  What would you do if my heart was torn in
   F
 two
                             Dm7
More than words to show you feel
           G              C
That your love for me is real
                G        Am         Em     F
What would you say if I took those words away
                               Dm7
Than you couldn't make things new
         G
Just by saying I love you

[Refr√£o]

C  F9             Dm7            F   G     
  Da ri da la ri ra ri la la ri la, more 
    C
than words
 F9             Dm7  G
Da ri da la ri ra

[Primeira Parte]

C                 F9      Dm7             F
  Now that I've tried to talk to you and 
       G      C
make you understand
         F9             Dm7               
All you have to do is close your eyes and 
 F         G         Am
just reach out your hands
     Dm7       G                   C     G  
And touch me, hold me close, don't ever let 
    Am
me go

[Segunda Parte]

           Dm7
More than words
   G           C7             F
Is all I ever needed you to show
          Fm               C            Am
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love 
me
      Dm7    G      C
Cause I'd already know

[Terceira Parte]

                G        Am        Em       F
What would you do if my heart was torn in two
                             Dm7
More than words to show you feel
           G              C
That your love for me is real
                G        Am         Em     F
What would you say if I took those words away
                               Dm7
Than you couldn't make things new
         G             C
Just by saying I love you
