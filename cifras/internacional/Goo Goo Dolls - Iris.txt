[Intro] Am  Am9  F  F7M
        Am  Am9  F  F7M

         C         Dm7      F
And I'd give up forever to touch you
          Am           G9          F
Cause I know that you feel me somehow
             C         Dm7        F
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever 
be
       Am            G9            F
And I don't want to go home right now
    C          Dm7           F
And all I can taste is this moment
    Am          G9            F
And all I can breath is your life
     C         Dm7       F
And sooner or later it's over
        Am            G9         F
I just don't want to miss you tonight

[Refrão]

       Am             G9       F
And I don't want the world to see me
         Am                G9          F
Cause I don't think that they'd understand
     Am            G9          F
When everything's made to be broken
        Am           G9       F
I just want you to know who I am

         C               Dm7             
And you can't fight the tears that ain't 
 F
coming
        Am         G9           F
Or the moment of truth in your lies
     C           Dm7        F
When everything feels like movies
            Am            G9          F
Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive

[Refrão]

       Am             G9       F
And I don't want the world to see me
         Am                G9          F
Cause I don't think that they'd understand
     Am            G9          F
When everything's made to be broken
        Am           G9       F
I just want you to know who I am
