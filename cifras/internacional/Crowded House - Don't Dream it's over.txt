[Intro] C  C  C

C                     Am
There is freedom within, there is freedom without
F                                  E E
Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup
C                      Am
There's a battle ahead, many battles are lost
F
But you'll never see the end of the road
             E            
While you're traveling with me

F        G
Hey now, hey now
C                Am
Don't dream it's over
F        G
Hey now, hey now
         C       Am
When the world comes in
F          G
They come, they come
C                    Am
To build a wall between us
F                     G
We know they won't win

C                      Am
Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof
F                                  E                     E
My possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof
C                      Am
In the paper today tales of war and of waste
F                                  E   
But you turn right over to the T.V. page

F        G
Hey now, hey now
C                Am
Don't dream it's over
F        G
Hey now, hey now
         C        Am
When the world comes in
F          G
They come, they come
C                    Am
To build a wall between us
F                     G
We know they won't win

C               Am
Now I'm walking again to the beat of a drum
F                                              E   
And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
C               Am
Only shadows ahead barely clearing the roof
F                                     E       
Get to know the feeling of liberation and release

Hey now, hey now
C                Am
Don't dream it's over
F        G
Hey now, hey now
         C        Am
When the world comes in
F          G
They come, they come
C                    Am
To build a wall between us
F                     G
We know they won't win
