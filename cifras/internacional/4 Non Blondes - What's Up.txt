[Primeira Parte]

C
  25 years of my life and still
   Dm                                       F
Tryin' to to get up that great big hill of hope
            C
For a destination

   C
I realized quickly when I knew I should
          Dm
That the world was made up of this
                F
Brotherhood of man
                   C
For whatever that means

           C
And so I cry sometimes, when I'm lying in bed
         Dm
Just to get it all out, what's in my head, then I
F                           C
  I am feeling, a little peculiar

          C
And so I wake in the morning, and I step outside
       Dm
And I take a deep breath, and I get real high and I
   F                                          C
Scream from the top of my lungs, What's going on

[Refrão]

            C                  Dm
And I say, Hey yeah yeah hey, hey yeah yeah
         F                C
I said, Hey, what's going on
            C                  Dm
And I say, Hey yeah yeah hey, hey yeah yeah
         F                C
I said, Hey, what's going on

[Segunda Parte]

        C                    Dm                F
And I try, oh my God, do I try, I try all the time
              C
In this institution

        C                     Dm
And I pray, oh my God, do I pray
                     F             C
I pray every single day for a revolution
           C
And so I cry sometimes, when I'm lying in bed
         Dm
Just to get it all out, what's in my head, then I
F                           C
  I am feeling, a little peculiar
          C
And so I wake in the morning, and I step outside
       Dm
And I take a deep breath and I get real high, and I
F                                               C
  Scream from the top of my lungs, What's going on

            C                  Dm
And I say, Hey yeah yeah hey, hey yeah yeah
             F              C
I said, Hey,   what's going on
            C                  Dm
And I say, Hey yeah yeah hey, hey yeah yeah
             F              C
