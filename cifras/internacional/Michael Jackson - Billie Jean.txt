[1ª Parte]

Am       Bm               C
    She was more like a beauty queen
  Bm
From a movie scene
Am          Bm
    I said don't mind
             C        Bm       Dm
But what do you mean: I am the one

Who will dance on the floor
        Am   Bm   C  Bm
In the round
                  Dm
She said I am the one

Who will dance on the floor
        Am   Bm   C  Bm
In the round

Am            Bm                 C
    She told me her name was Billie Jean
Bm
As she caused a scene
Am         Bm                   C
    Then every head turned with eyes
                 Bm       Dm
That dreamed of being the one

Who will dance on the floor
        Am   Bm   C  Bm
In the round

 F
People always told me:
    Am
Be careful of what you do
           F
And don't go around
                       Am
Breaking young girl's hearts
    F
My mother always told me:
    Am
Be careful of who you love
        F
And be careful of what you do
            E7
'Cause the lie becomes the truth

Am      Bm          C      Bm
    Billie Jean is not my lover
Am             Bm
    She's just a girl
      C         Bm       Dm
Who claims that I am the one
                       Am   Bm   C
But the kid is not my son
         Bm       Dm
She says I am the one
                       Am   Bm
But the kid is not my son

( C  Bm )

[2ª Parte]

Am       Bm             C
    For forty days and forty nights
     Bm
The law was on her side
Am           Bm
    But who can stand
           C
When she's in demand
 Bm               Dm
Her schemes and plans

'Cause we danced on the floor
        Am   Bm   C  Bm
In the round
                     Dm
So take my strong advice
                                Am
Just remember to always think twice
Bm              C         Bm
    (Do think twice, do think twice)
Am             Bm
    She told: my baby
            C
We danced 'til three
  Bm
Then she looked at me
Am              Bm          C
    Then showed a photo my baby cried
    Bm              Dm
His eyes were like mine

'Cause we danced on the floor
        Am   Bm   C  Bm
In the round, baby

 F
People always told me
    Am
Be careful of what you do
           F
And don't go around
                       Am
Breaking young girl's hearts
         F
But she came and stood right by me
          Am
Just to smell her sweet perfume
      F
This happened much too soon
     E7
She called me to her room
