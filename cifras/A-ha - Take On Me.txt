A-HA - Take On Me

Dm          G
We're talking away
C                 F         C4/E
I don't know what   I'm to say
      Dm        G
I'll say it anyway
   C             F      C4/E
Today's another day to find you
Dm           G   Am
    Shying away
                         F
I'll be coming for your love, ok

Take me   on
C     G   Am
I'll be  gone
F             C     G   Am   F
  In a day or   two

 Dm          G
Needless to say
    C
I'm odds and ends
F           C4/E   Dm        G
  But I'll be    stumbling away
  C                   F      C4/E
Slowly learning that life is ok
Dm             G
    Say after me

  In a day or   two
