Intro: Am F G 2x

Am
   There's a fire starting in my heart
 G                             F
Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out 
the dark
Am
 Finally, I can see you crystal clear
G                             F
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your 
ship bare
Am
See how  I'll leave with every piece of you
G                             F
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
Am
   There's a fire starting in my heart
G                             F
Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out 
the dark

F               G                  Em
  The scars of your love remind me of us
               F
They keep me thinking that we almost had it 
all
              G                       
The scars of your love, they leave me 
  Em
breathless
              F
I can't help feeling

                     Am   G
We could have had it all
                F
Rolling in the deep
                   Am            G
You had my heart inside of your hand
           F
And you played it

To the beat
                     Am   G
We could have had it all
                F
Rolling in the deep
                   Am            G
You had my heart inside of your hand
           F
And you played it

To the beat

Am              F
A carne é fraca, não sou de lata
C                     G    (Riff 1)
O corpo pede, eu vou obedecer
Am              F        (Riff 3)
É meu instinto tudo o que sinto
G          (Riff4)      D         (Harm)
Eu vou em busca do que dá prazer
             F
Me deixei levar
 G                  Am
Ah, foi de momento, não foi sem querer
            F G                      Am
Percebi no ar aquele cheiro que vem pra me 
enlouquecer

                                 G       
Sem me controlar, te pego, te abraço, te 
          Am
beijo na boca
             F                     Am
Você se segurando, me diz não ser louca
                      G                    
Quer ter tudo no seu tempo, tudo num certo 
   Am
momento ai ai ai
                                 G       
Sem me controlar, te pego, te abraço, te 
          Am
beijo na boca
             F                     Am
Você se segurando, me diz não ser louca
                      G                    
Quer ter tudo no seu tempo, tudo num certo 
   Am
